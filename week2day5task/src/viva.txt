1️⃣ What is Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe?

Answer:
Fail-Fast iterators immediately throw ConcurrentModificationException if the collection is modified during iteration.
Fail-Safe iterators do not throw exceptions because they work on a separate copy of the collection, allowing safe modification during iteration.

2️⃣ Why does ConcurrentModificationException occur?

Answer:
It occurs when we modify a collection structurally (add/remove elements) while iterating using an iterator of Fail-Fast collections (like ArrayList, HashMap).
Java detects this unexpected modification using modCount and throws the exception to prevent inconsistent behavior.

3️⃣ Real-World Example of Fail-Safe Usage

Answer:
Fail-Safe is useful where real-time updates are needed while iterating, like:
Hospital emergency doctor list, live user session tracking, notification systems, stock data processing.
Collections like CopyOnWriteArrayList and ConcurrentHashMap are used.

4️⃣ Difference Between Iterator and ListIterator

Answer:

Iterator	ListIterator
Works for List and Set	Works only for List
Forward traversal only	Can traverse forward & backward
Cannot add elements during iteration	Can add, remove, modify elements
